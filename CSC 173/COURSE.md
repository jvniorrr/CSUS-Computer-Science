# CSC 173

\_Repository sharing my works from CSC 173 during the Fall 2023 seemester with Anna Baynes. I hope this can help others who are taking the same course or want to learn more about the topics. Please do not use this as a substitute for your own work or learning. You should always try to solve the problems yourself and understand the concepts behind them. This is only meant to be a resource to help you learn, not to cheat. This course aims at enabling students to become more familiar with the processes and results of data processing. \_
