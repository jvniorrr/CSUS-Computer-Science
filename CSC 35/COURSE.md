# CSC 35
_This repository contains my works from CSC 35 during the Spring 22' semester with Professor Devin Cook. The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for sharing my knowledge and previous works with others who are interested in learning about computer architecture. By making this repository available to the public, I hope to provide a valuable resource for students and enthusiasts who are looking to expand their knowledge in this field.

This repository is intended for research purposes only. It is important to note that this repository is not meant to be used as a means of cheating. Instead, it is designed to serve as a learning tool for those who are interested in studying computer architecture.

It is also worth noting that technology is constantly evolving, and it is not the responsibility of the repository owner if professors choose to utilize the same materials across multiple semesters. This repository is intended to be a resource for those who wish to learn and should be used as such._
