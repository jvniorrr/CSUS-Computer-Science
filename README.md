# CSUS-Computer-Science
This repository is a work in progress and contains my works for some of the courses I have taken at CSUS. The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for sharing my knowledge and previous works with others who are interested in learning from my experiences at California State University, Sacramento. Whether you are a fellow student or simply interested in the subject matter, I hope that you find this repository to be a helpful resource.

This repository is intended to be used as a learning resource. As such, I encourage others to use it as a tool to enhance their own understanding and to further their education. Please note that this repository should not be used for any form of academic misconduct, such as plagiarism or cheating.

It is important to emphasize that this repository should be used for educational purposes only and not as a means of cheating. The works contained in this repository should not be submitted as one's own or used to complete assignments for academic credit. Instead, they are designed to help others understand and learn from my coursework, and to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing within the academic community. 

Lastly, it is worth noting that technology is constantly evolving, and it is not the responsibility of the repository owner if professors choose to utilize the same materials across multiple semesters. This repository is intended to be a resource for those who wish to learn and should be used as such.
