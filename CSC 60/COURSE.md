# CSC 60
This repository contains my work from the CSC 60 course during Fall 22' with Sankar Srivatsa. I have shared this repository to help others who might encounter difficulties while learning.

The purpose of this repository is to provide information on shell commands, the C Programming language, and UNIX/Linux systems.

Feel free to explore the code, assignments, and projects in this repository. You may also find useful resources and documentation on these topics.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.
